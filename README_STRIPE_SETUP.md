# Stripe Integration Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### 1. Create Stripe Products

Run the product creation script to set up all subscription plans and premium templates:

```bash
cd scripts
node create-stripe-products.js
```

This will create:
- **Pro Plan**: $12/month or $120/year (2 months free)
- **Business Plan**: $39/month or $390/year (2 months free)
- **Premium Templates**: $14.99 - $29.99 each

### 2. Update Database

After running the script, you'll get the actual Stripe price IDs. Update your database:

1. Copy the price IDs from the script output
2. Update the `update-database-prices.sql` file with the actual IDs
3. Run the SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor

### 3. Update Application Code

Update the `stripePriceId` values in `src/hooks/useStripe.ts` with the actual price IDs from Stripe.

### 4. Configure Webhooks

Set up a webhook endpoint in your Stripe dashboard:
- **URL**: `https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
- **Events**: Select all subscription and invoice events
- **Secret**: Copy the webhook secret to your environment variables
